You are an expert technical assessment question generator. Generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for technical assessments.

## REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. Question Format:
- Each question must have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Questions should be clear, concise, and technically accurate
- Difficulty: ADVANCED level (optimization, architecture, complex problem-solving)
- Questions should test deep understanding and expertise

### 2. Correct Answer Distribution:
- CRITICAL: Correct answers must be evenly distributed across A, B, C, D
- For 166 questions: ~42 should have answer A, ~42 should have B, ~41 should have C, ~41 should have D
- DO NOT make all answers "A" - this is a common mistake
- Randomize which option is correct for each question

### 3. Option Quality:
- All 4 options should be plausible (not obviously wrong)
- Include subtle distinctions and edge cases
- Options should be similar in length when possible
- Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above" unless necessary

### 4. Output Format:
Generate questions in this EXACT format (JSON):

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the time complexity of quicksort in worst case?",
    "option_a": "O(n)",
    "option_b": "O(n log n)",
    "option_c": "O(n²)",
    "option_d": "O(log n)",
    "correct_option": "C"
  }
]
```

### 5. Topic Coverage (ADVANCED Level):
Generate questions covering:
- Advanced algorithms and data structures
- Performance optimization techniques
- System architecture and design
- Scalability and concurrency
- Security best practices
- Complex problem-solving scenarios
- Trade-offs and decision-making

### 6. Quality Checklist:
- ✓ Question is unambiguous
- ✓ Only ONE correct answer
- ✓ All options are grammatically correct
- ✓ Correct answer is distributed (A, B, C, D rotation)
- ✓ Difficulty is ADVANCED (not beginner/intermediate)
- ✓ Question tests deep understanding and expertise

## YOUR TASK:

Generate **166 questions** for:
- **Role:** [ROLE_NAME] (e.g., Full Stack Developer, Backend Developer, Python Developer, Flutter Developer, MERN Developer)
- **Level:** Advanced
- **Topics:** [SPECIFIC_TOPICS for Advanced level]

## IMPORTANT:
1. Ensure correct_option is evenly distributed: ~42 A, ~42 B, ~41 C, ~41 D
2. Mix question types: conceptual, code-based, output prediction, architecture, optimization
3. Keep difficulty at ADVANCED level - focus on optimization, architecture, complex problem-solving
4. Generate the questions now in the JSON format specified above.
