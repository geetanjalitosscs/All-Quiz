You are an expert technical assessment question generator. Generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for technical assessments.

## REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. Question Format:
- Each question must have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Questions should be clear, concise, and technically accurate
- Difficulty: BEGINNER level (fundamentals, basics, syntax)
- Questions should test practical knowledge, not just memorization

### 2. Correct Answer Distribution:
- CRITICAL: Correct answers must be evenly distributed across A, B, C, D
- For 167 questions: ~42 should have answer A, ~42 should have B, ~42 should have C, ~41 should have D
- DO NOT make all answers "A" - this is a common mistake
- Randomize which option is correct for each question

### 3. Option Quality:
- All 4 options should be plausible (not obviously wrong)
- Include common mistakes as distractors
- Options should be similar in length when possible
- Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above" unless necessary

### 4. Output Format:
Generate questions in this EXACT format (JSON):

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What does HTML stand for?",
    "option_a": "Hyper Text Markup Language",
    "option_b": "High Tech Modern Language",
    "option_c": "Home Tool Markup Language",
    "option_d": "Hyperlinks and Text Markup Language",
    "correct_option": "A"
  }
]
```

### 5. Topic Coverage (BEGINNER Level):
Generate questions covering:
- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Basic syntax and language features
- Simple code examples
- Common terminology
- Basic best practices

### 6. Quality Checklist:
- ✓ Question is unambiguous
- ✓ Only ONE correct answer
- ✓ All options are grammatically correct
- ✓ Correct answer is distributed (A, B, C, D rotation)
- ✓ Difficulty is BEGINNER (not intermediate/advanced)
- ✓ Question tests understanding, not memorization

## YOUR TASK:

Generate **167 questions** for:
- **Role:** [ROLE_NAME] (e.g., Full Stack Developer, Backend Developer, Python Developer, Flutter Developer, MERN Developer)
- **Level:** Beginner
- **Topics:** [SPECIFIC_TOPICS for Beginner level]

## IMPORTANT:
1. Ensure correct_option is evenly distributed: ~42 A, ~42 B, ~42 C, ~41 D
2. Mix question types: conceptual, code-based, output prediction, best practices
3. Keep difficulty at BEGINNER level - focus on basics, syntax, fundamental concepts
4. Generate the questions now in the JSON format specified above.
